marketplace to democratize the $85 trillion global funds industry, enables you to invest with the best crypto \u0026 ICO investors. For the first time in history, investors can withdraw their funds from any fund, at any time, with proof of trader fees and past investment performance, on the blockchain. CoTrade together via blockchain smart-funds using decentralized exchanges and smart escrows, without sending and keeping all your investment funds on dangerous 3rd party exchanges. Our Super-DEX and smart escrow infrastructure combines not just all DEXs, but also tokenizes all assets on any exchange, and even supports ICOs with pre-whitelisting and bulk-buy bonuses. Finally, privacy together with liquidity, transparency, and assurance of smart-contracts, all on-chain.CoTrader via smart-funds with the best crypto \u0026 ICO traders using P2P DEX - without sending and keeping all your copy trading funds on dangerous 3rd party exchanges. Proof of performance and privacy for fund managers.\r\nCoTrader’s working blockchain platform is the world's first trustless investment funds marketplace, which aims to disrupt the $85 trillion global funds industry. \r\nUnlike competitors, CoTrader offers transparent smart-funds that decouple fund management from custodianship; Fund fees and past ROIs are proven on the blockchain, and smart contracts provides investors with the assurance that only investors can ever withdraw their funds at any time. Fund managers, called traders, can set their own performance fees and make trades on behalf of their investors, called cotraders, but traders can not withdraw others’ funds.\r\n\r\nUsers automatically build up a performance history by using smart funds. Top traders and influencers have tremendous incentive to be listed in the CoTrader marketplace and compete for investors, because this leverages and multiplies their own earnings enormously.\r\n\r\nCoTrader ties together multiple decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like Kyber, Bancor, and 0x to form a super-DEX for maximum liquidity. \r\n\r\nBeyond decentralized exchanges: CoTrader can tokenize all assets on any exchanges, from Binance to Ameritrade, with its smart escrow exchange protocol, which will later support financial assets beyond cryptos, including pre-ICO futures, stocks, shorts, and derivatives.\r\n\r\nCoTrader takes 20% of managers’ fees. For example, if a fund manager charges a 20% performance fee, CoTrader takes 20% of that 20%, which would be 4% total. All platform profits are used to buy back COT tokens. A DAO holds these tokens and can use them to fund further development of the platform.\r\n\r\nCOT tokens are used to pay platform fees. The COT token will be required to hide the trading strategies of Traders, using our patent-pending protocol-agnostic technology.","subcategory":null,"created_at":"2018-07-16T15:22:26.113-06:00","updated_at":"2019-01-23T17:08:02.580-07:00","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/574164/","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/cotrader","wikipedia":"","twitter":"https://twitter.com/cotrader_com","phone":"","email":"team@cotrader.com","funding":10.0,"sector":"ICO","sector2":"P2P","sector3":"Funds","blockplusinsur":false,"medium":"https://medium.com/@cotrader.com/","hastoken":true,"symbol":"COT","charities":"","googleplus":"https://plus.google.com/109756867677456154433","slack":"","youtube":"https://www.youtube.com/c/cotrader","pinterest":"","github":"https://github.com/CoTraderCore","reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/cotrader","instagram":"https://www.instagram.com/cotradercom/","whitepaper":"","angellist":"","skype":"","telegram":"https://t.me/cotrader","chat":"https://t.me/cotrader","discord":"","tumblr":"","snapchat":"","wechat":"","dashready":false,"dashadded":"2019-01-23T17:07:00.000-07:00","tag_list":["ICO"],"logo_item":"https://fintechapp.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ioyWNzAQhvz6iHQzTG25HiFv?response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3D%22cotrader.jpg%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27cotrader.jpg\u0026response-content-type=image%2Fjpeg\u0026X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=AKIAJG6DG75G7BXQ3XUA%2F20201227%2Fus-east-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-Date=20201227T154956Z\u0026X-Amz-Expires=518400\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026X-Amz-Signature=9507ae9e723ec93206642e08c99492941c08fc03fca914b86a8b7d784aff9044"},{"id":1992,"name":"Covalent","website":"https://www.covalenthq.com/","founders":null,"founding_yr":null,"city":"Vancouver","state":"","country":"CA","region":"Canada","category":"blockchain","description":"Covalent is an  Ethereum-focused data analytics firm based in a Vancouver, Canada.","subcategory":"CapitalMarkets","created_at":"2020-10-07T23:17:48.433-06:00","updated_at":"2020-10-07T23:17:48.433-06:00","linkedin":null,"facebook":null,"wikipedia":null,"twitter":null,"phone":null,"email":null,"funding":null,"sector":null,"sector2":null,"sector3":null,"blockplusinsur":null,"medium":null,"hastoken":null,"symbol":null,"charities":null,"googleplus":null,"slack":null,"youtube":null,"pinterest":null,"github":null,"reddit":null,"instagram":null,"whitepaper":null,"angellist":null,"skype":null,"telegram":null,"chat":null,"discord":null,"tumblr":null,"snapchat":null,"wechat":null,"dashready":null,"dashadded":null,"tag_list":[],"logo_item":null},{"id":452,"name":"Cove","website":"https://www.coveinsurance.co.nz/","founders":"Rob Coon, Brett Wilson y Andy Coon","founding_yr":2016,"city":"Auckland","state":"","country":"NZ","region":"Oceania","category":"insurtech","description":"Cove is founded by \"Kiwis, and made for the people of New Zealand, according to its website.
