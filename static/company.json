CoTrade together via blockchain smart-funds using decentralized exchanges and smart escrows, without sending and keeping all your investment funds on dangerous 3rd party exchanges.

Finally, privacy together with liquidity, transparency, and assurance of smart-contracts, all on-chain.CoTrader via smart-funds with the best crypto \u0026 ICO traders using P2P DEX - without sending and keeping all your copy trading funds on dangerous 3rd party exchanges. Proof of performance and privacy for fund managers.\r\nCoTrader’s working blockchain platform is the world's first trustless investment funds marketplace, which aims to disrupt the $85 trillion global funds industry. \r\nUnlike competitors, CoTrader offers transparent smart-funds that decouple fund management from custodianship; Fund fees and past ROIs are proven on the blockchain, and smart contracts provides investors with the assurance that only investors can ever withdraw their funds at any time. Fund managers, called traders, can set their own performance fees and make trades on behalf of their investors, called cotraders, but traders can not withdraw others’ funds.\r\n\r\nUsers automatically build up a performance history by using smart funds. Top traders and influencers have tremendous incentive to be listed in the CoTrader marketplace and compete for investors, because this leverages and multiplies their own earnings enormously.\r\n\r\nCoTrader ties together multiple decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like Kyber, Bancor, and 0x to form a super-DEX for maximum liquidity. \r\n\r\nBeyond decentralized exchanges: CoTrader can tokenize all assets on any exchanges, from Binance to Ameritrade, with its smart escrow exchange protocol, which will later support financial assets beyond cryptos, including pre-ICO futures, stocks, shorts, and derivatives.\r\n\r\nCoTrader takes 20% of managers’ fees. For example, if a fund manager charges a 20% performance fee, CoTrader takes 20% of that 20%, which would be 4% total. All platform profits are used to buy back COT tokens. A DAO holds these tokens and can use them to fund further development of the platform.\r\n\r\nCOT tokens are used to pay platform fees. The COT token will be required to hide the trading strategies of Traders, using our patent-pending protocol-agnostic technology.","subcategory":null,"created_at":"2018-07-16T15:22:26.113-06:00","updated_at":"2019-01-23T17:08:02.580-07:00","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/574164/","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/cotrader","wikipedia":"","twitter":"https://twitter.com/cotrader_com","phone":"","email":"team@cotrader.com","funding":10.0,"sector":"ICO","sector2":"P2P","sector3":"Funds","blockplusinsur":false,"medium":"https://medium.com/@cotrader.com/","hastoken":true,"symbol":"COT","charities":"","googleplus":"https://plus.google.com/109756867677456154433","slack":"","youtube":"https://www.youtube.com/c/cotrader","pinterest":"","github":"https://github.com/CoTraderCore","reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/cotrader","instagram":"https://www.instagram.com/cotradercom/","whitepaper":"","angellist":"","skype":"","telegram":"https://t.me/cotrader","chat":"https://t.me/cotrader","discord":"","tumblr":"","snapchat":"","wechat":"","dashready":false,"dashadded":"2019-01-23T17:07:00.000-07:00","tag_list":["ICO"],"logo_item":"https://fintechapp.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ioyWNzAQhvz6iHQzTG25HiFv?response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3D%22cotrader.jpg%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27cotrader.jpg\u0026response-content-type=image%2Fjpeg\u0026X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=AKIAJG6DG75G7BXQ3XUA%2F20201227%2Fus-east-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-Date=20201227T072212Z\u0026X-Amz-Expires=518400\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026X-Amz-Signature=4a1136a2ad511542e20a6ccadd52aa72f32176888e998c83b8f6f51f3336e227"},{"id":1992,"name":"Covalent","website":"https://www.covalenthq.com/","founders":null,"founding_yr":null,"city":"Vancouver","state":"","country":"CA","region":"Canada","category":"blockchain","description":"Covalent is an  Ethereum-focused data analytics firm based in a Vancouver, Canada.","subcategory":"CapitalMarkets","created_at":"2020-10-07T23:17:48.433-06:00","updated_at":"2020-10-07T23:17:48.433-06:00","linkedin":null,"facebook":null,"wikipedia":null,"twitter":null,"phone":null,"email":null,"funding":null,"sector":null,"sector2":null,"sector3":null,"blockplusinsur":null,"medium":null,"hastoken":null,"symbol":null,"charities":null,"googleplus":null,"slack":null,"youtube":null,"pinterest":null,"github":null,"reddit":null,"instagram":null,"whitepaper":null,"angellist":null,"skype":null,"telegram":null,"chat":null,"discord":null,"tumblr":null,"snapchat":null,"wechat":null,"dashready":null,"dashadded":null,"tag_list":[],"logo_item":null},{"id":452,"name":"Cove","website":"https://www.coveinsurance.co.nz/","founders":"Rob Coon, Brett Wilson y Andy Coon","founding_yr":2016,"city":"Auckland","state":"","country":"NZ","region":"Oceania","category":"insurtech","description":"Cove is founded by \"Kiwis, and made for the people of New Zealand, according to its website.

With a hybrid consensus model, we have built the only decentralized, democratized currency where everyone has a real voice.\r\n\r\nSince 2016, we have been thriving with the only decentralized monetary model that gives users a real voice. We believe that striking a balance between infrastructure owners and currency holders is the only way to build a robust currency now—and for the long-term.\r\n\r\nOur platform is built from 100% proven technology. Our modular codebase allows us to enhance our offering with the latest technology without interruption of trading or loss of value. We are proud to say that Decred is completely independent, community funded, and community owned. Its hybrid consensus system ensures that no group can control the flow of transactions or make changes to the currency without the input of the community.\r\n\r\nDecred has won accolades from industry experts, investors and the media. Hailed by Crypto Economy as “one of the most interesting current projects, both for the current characteristics and those that will be implemented in the near future,” we are working toward a future where currency is democratized as well as decentralized, where the people—not corporations, nor a handful of elite individuals—are empowered.","subcategory":null,"created_at":"2018-08-05T01:16:42.096-06:00","updated_at":"2019-01-22T09:12:41.420-07:00","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/decredproject/","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/decredproject","wikipedia":"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q25104171","twitter":"https://twitter.com/decredproject","phone":"
