The fact is, there's money to made in non de-centralized coins because it's easier for outside communities to adopt.  Enter Agrello. It's AI/Smartcontracts which is HUGE lately and on top of that it's for Lawyers. If there's one gigantic inflated industry that has a ridiculously inflated price, it's Lawyers. The law industry is insanely massive and there will always be lawyers. No one else is doing Smartcontracts for Lawyers.  https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/agrello-delta/  And this thing is only at 87 Mil market cap meaning it has SO much room to grow and 87 Mil is such a sweet spot for growth where it's big enough to be noticed, see PRL and SNOV lately (this is even on Binance!). Compare to something like QTum with a market cap of 6 Billion. Top it all of that this coin is only $1 right now meaning all the dumb money that loves low priced coins is going to pile into this.  Typical shill about their great team and communicative Dev team, but seriously, these guys are legit. Tell me this isn't a sexy website: https://www.agrello.org/ . And if Aesthetics aren't your thing, the roadmap is actually legit with lots of platform releases coming this month/next month: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2FgsA8HZcI\u0026t  Seriously. 85 Mil market cap and on Binance. This thing is going to crack top 100 and absolutely moon to 3-4x in a day. PRL went 3x in 3 days and this is honestly an even bigger industry.

They help to identify weaknesses as well as highlight where you’re having success against your competitors.\r\n\r\nTo put it simply: If you’re not measuring your performance against that of your peers, you’re falling behind the competition.\r\nWhen starting a B2B competitive analysis, it can often seem overwhelming. It’s often a struggle to identify comparable competitors and metrics as well as sift through the mountains of data. So much information, so little time, amiright?\r\n\r\nIt’s because of this that I’ve put together a list of the 5 most important things (IMO) to pay attention to.\r\n\r\n1. What is your competition’s overall domain authority?\r\nA great place to start on your competitive analysis is with domain authority. The domain authority numbers can give you a high level view of where you stand against the competition.\r\n\r\nDomain authority basically summarizes the overall “authority” of a site.\r\n\r\nIn the example below, I used Moz, which rates websites from 0-100 with 100 being the best. Of the 5 different websites I plugged in, Moz automatically identified the highest, which in this example was Apple.com.\r\n","rating":null,"published_on":"2016-08-25","auth":"PHOEBE FASULO","folder":"insurtech","created_at":"2018-10-17T03:21:35.720-06:00","updated_at":"2018-10-17T03:21:35.720-06:00","header":"5 Things to Pay Attention to in a B2B Competitive Analysis","publication":"KOMARKETING","sector":"Exchange","sector2":"","sector3":"","company_id":null,"tag_list":[]},{"id":234,"url":"https://medium.com/s/story/how-does-the-blockchain-work-98c8cd01d2ae","user_id":48,"restype":"report","description":"A good intro to bitcoin, blockchain, and the its ecosystem","rating":null,"published_on":"2016-06-01","auth":"Michele D'Aliessi ","folder":"blockchain","created_at":"2018-09-01T16:25:10.971-06:00","updated_at":"2018-09-01T16:25:10.971-06:00","header":"\r\nHow Does the Blockchain Work?","publication":"Medium","sector":"","sector2":"","sector3":"","company_id":null,"tag_list":["Fintech U"]},{"id":219,"url":"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/high-tech/our-insights/how-blockchains-could-change-the-world","user_id":48,"restype":"report","description":"A great explanation for what blockchain is,, and its potential for disruption","rating":10,"published_on":"2016-05-01","auth":"Don Tapscott,Rik Kirkland","folder":"blockchain","created_at":"2018-08-29T13:33:34.609-06:00","updated_at":"2018-08-29T13:34:43.529-06:00","header":"\r\nHow blockchains could change the world","publication":"McKinsey Publishing","sector":"","sector2":"","sector3":"","company_id":null,"tag_list":["Fintech U"]},{"id":3523,"url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2016/06/15/elizabeth-rossiello-describes-how-bitpesa-slashes-international-payment-fees/#3a78dc432a6d","user_id":48,"restype":"report","description":"","rating":3,"published_on":"2016-02-22","auth":"Forbes","folder":"insurtech","created_at":"2019-12-19T02:29:13.326-07:00","updated_at":"2019-12-19T02:29:13.326-07:00","header":"Forbes Interview with Bitpesa","publication":"Forbes","sector":"","sector2":"","sector3":"","company_id":null,"tag_list":[]},{"id":296,"url":"https://bravenewcoin.com/insights/ten-companies-using-the-blockchain-for-non-financial-innovation","user_id":48,"restype":"report","description":"Good examples of uses for blockchain outside of finance","rating":7,"published_on":"2015-12-15","auth":"","folder":"blockchain","created_at":"2018-10-06T23:39:14.732-06:00","updated_at":"2018-10-06T23:39:14.732-06:00","header":"Ten companies using the blockchain for non-financial innovation","publication":"BraveNewCoin","sector":"","sector2":"","sector3":"","company_id":null,"tag_list":["Lists"]},{"id":42,"url":"https://www.wired.com/2015/12/bitcoins-creator-satoshi-nakamoto-is-probably-this-unknown-australian-genius/","user_id":48,"restype":"news","description":"Authors Greenberg and Branwen  go through the evidence and suggest that an unknown Australian is most likely the inventor of Bitcoin.
